# A Generalized Delay and Backlog Analysis for Multiplexing URLLC and eMBB: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces or Decode-and-Forward?

## Introduction
- This repository is the implementation of "A Generalized Delay and Backlog Analysis for Multiplexing URLLC and eMBB: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces or Decode-and-Forward?", which has submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications.
- This study proposed accurate delay and backlog analysis based on Martingale theory for URLLC and eMBB multiplexing with respect to different heterogeneous networks, such as MISO, DF relay and RIS-assisted systems, and two-hop architechture.
- The implementation of DF relay and RIS-assisted communications is referred to [Prof. Emil Bj√∂rnson's work: IRS-relaying](https://github.com/emilbjornson/IRS-relaying/tree/master).
